# Local Weather

 ## Description
Upon arriving on this page, the application should include a search bar to input a US zip code and a current day button.  When a user inputs a valid US zip code and clicks the current day button or clicks enter, the current weather of the zip code the user entered should display in a card. On the card, there should be a 5 day button that displays the 5 day forecast of the current city chosen.
